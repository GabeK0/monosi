A simple and robust web application can now be used to set up monitors on specific data sources and alert on anomalies.\\n\\nFind more information on getting started with the Monosi web interface [here](/docs/user-guide/introduction).\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/changelog/v003/ui_interface_v003.gif\' />\\n\\n### Docker Image Deployment\\n\\nWe have provided a Monosi [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/monosi/monosi) to run the new web interface and simplify deployment.\\n\\nYou can run the application via docker and deploy it accordingly with dockerfiles/compose/nginx config files. More information can be found [here](/docs/guides/quick-install).\\n\\n```\\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 monosi/monosi\\n```\\n\\n### PostgreSQL Support\\n\\nMonosi now supports PostgreSQL as a core driver. More information on setting up a Postgres connection for the CLI can be found [here](/docs/integrations/postgresql). To setup a connection in the web interface, simply navigate to the datasources page.\\n\\nAlong with adding PostgreSQL, the driver implementation has been refactored to simplify adding support for other datasources. [Open an issue](https://github.com/monosidev/monosi/issues) for the data source you want Monosi to support.\\n\\n```\\ncat ~/.monosi/workspaces.yml\\n\\ndefault:\\n  sources:\\n    default: \\n      type: postgres\\n      user: <USER>\\n      password: <PASSWORD>\\n      host: <HOST>\\n      port: <PORT>\\n      database: <DATABASE>\\n```\\n\\n### Slack Alert Integrations\\n\\nMonosi can now send alerts to Slack channels when anomalies are detected (Web Interface only). Alerts are sent through [channel webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). More information can be found [here](/docs/integrations/slack).\\n\\nThe Slack alert format is still being determined. Join the discussion on how to format alerts in our [Slack community](https://monosi.dev/slack).\\n\\n<img src=\'/img/changelog/v003/Monosi_Slack_Alert.svg\' />\\n\\n### Schema Change Monitoring\\n\\nWe have added a new monitor type for tracking schema changes (CLI only). If at any point a monitored table experiences a schema change, Monosi will alert on the anomaly. More information on schema monitors can be found [here](https://docs.monosi.dev/).\\n\\n```\\nmonosi:\\n  monitors:\\n    - type: schema\\n      table: snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf100.orders\\n      columns:\\n        - name: o_custkey\\n          type: integer\\n          order: 1\\n        - name: o_orderdate\\n          type: date\\n          order: 2\\n        - name: o_comment\\n          type: string\\n          order: 3\\n```\\n\\n### Driver Refactors & Bug Fixes\\n\\nA driver code refactor was introduced with v0.0.3 to support easier development of database driver integrations.\\n\\nFurthermore, bug fixes and code changes have been made to make Monosi increasingly more stable as we approach v0.1."},{"id":"v002","metadata":{"permalink":"/changelog/v002","editUrl":"https://github.com/monosidev/monosi/documentation/blob/master/changelog/2022-01-20-v002-release.md","source":"@site/changelog/2022-01-20-v002-release.md","title":"v0.0.2 Release","description":"Built-in Scheduler, Custom SQL Monitors, Database Profiler, & more.","date":"2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 20, 2022","tags":[{"label":"releases","permalink":"/changelog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":1.19,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Unkrich","title":"Co-Founder","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15347345?v=4"}],"prevItem":{"title":"v0.0.3 Release","permalink":"/changelog/v003"},"nextItem":{"title":"v0.0.1 Release","permalink":"/changelog/v001"}},"content":"Built-in Scheduler, Custom SQL Monitors, Database Profiler, & more.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\nMonosi\'s v0.0.2 release brings a number of compelling features to the toolkit, which we believe will be incredibly useful.\\n\\nDive into the features that we\'ve introduced below, or take a look at past updates.\\n\\n### Monosi Scheduler & Server\\n\\nWith the introduction of v0.0.2 comes a built-in scheduler and server.

All the necessary dependencies for Monosi to run are managed through Docker Compose, making it easy to start with just 3 commands:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/monosidev/monosi.git
cd monosi
make compose
</code></pre><h2>Integration Support</h2><p>Support for Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and Redshift has been added. </p><p>You can also receive alerts via webhooks and Slack.</p><h3>Documentation</h3><p>Documentation has been added to the project and is available at <a href="https://docs.monosi.dev">https://docs.monosi.dev</a></p><h3>Testing &amp; Bug fixes</h3><p>More tests have been added to ensure the reliability of the code.
